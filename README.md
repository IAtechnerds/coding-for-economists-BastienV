Coding for economists assignment - Death Penalty dataset -

In this study, we use a death penalty in the US dataset to see who are the kind of murderers based on sex and race. 

In the main branch, you will find the dataset and the read.me file and an exercise using Python.
In the master branch, you will find the code from stata and the graph uploaded in PDF

I pushed my data from stata to github using git language. However, I could not transfer my documents from main to master.

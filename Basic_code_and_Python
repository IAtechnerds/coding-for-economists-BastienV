*for this exercise, I used a sentence to create basic Python functions*

sample_sentence = 'We are going to study death penalty in the US'
sample_sentence[0:21]
sample_sentence[10]
sample_sentence.split()
len(sample_sentence)
sample_sentence.upper()

*To try loops with Python, I used three words refering to race of murderers*

words = ["Black", "White", "Latinx"]

for word in words:
    if word == "Black":
        print("This word refers to people who are in minority condemned to death penalty.")
    elif word == "White":
        print("This word refers to people who are mostly condemned to death penalty.")
    elif word == "Latinx":
        print("This word refers to people who are in minority condemned to death penalty.")
    else:
        print("No one is condemned.")
